# cleanTF2cfgs
A blank set of TF2 configs for easy drag/drop + editing.

I set this up for me, but if you want to use this too:
This assumes you have [tf2-loadouts-script](https://github.com/jooonior/tf2-loadouts-script) set up, and accounts for it (because its what I like using)

and then you can make sure it works by switching between classes.
Console should return "Testing! Binds cleared." followed by "Testing! Switched to (class)."

Also configs are put into tf/cfg/app/(class).cfg because of mastercomfig.
If you're not using mastercomfig, just put them in tf/cfg instead, it should basically be the same execution otherwise.
